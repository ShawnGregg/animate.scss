# Animate.scss

This is a fork of Geoff Graham's https://github.com/geoffgraham/animate.scss

Which is a port of Dan Eden's [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for SASS.

Go to these places for more info.

## What are you doing?

Just making some mods so that it works with my sass setup and dropping the css and other files.
